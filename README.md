ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm **Tej Sharma**, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Buffalo NY.

ðŸŒ± **Current Learning**
I am a passionate AI enthusiast | Quantitative Researcher | and Machine Learning Engineer with expertise in large-scale data analysis across healthcare and finance. My research focuses on integrating multi-omics data, clinical records, and financial datasets to uncover hidden patterns, predict disease mechanisms, and optimize decision-making systems.

ðŸ”¬ In Healthcare & Bioinformatics, I leverage machine learning, deep learning, and AI to:
Decipher disease mechanisms and immunotherapy resistance.
Identify novel therapeutic targets using genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics.
Develop predictive models for patient stratification and drug response.

ðŸ“Š In Quantitative Finance, I apply statistical modeling, time-series analysis, and algorithmic strategies to:
Analyze market trends and risk factors using alternative datasets.
Build robust trading signals and portfolio optimization models.
Detect anomalies in high-frequency financial data.

ðŸ¤– Emerging Interests:
Large Language Models (LLMs) for biomedical literature mining and financial sentiment analysis.
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for cross-domain knowledge discovery.
Expanding horizons in AI with High-performance computing (HPC) and distributed systems for scalable data processing.

### ðŸ‘¯ Collaboration Interests
I'm excited to collaborate and work  on innovative bioinformatics and data science projects. With a deep passion for data analysis and predictive statistics, I thrive on exploring new methodologies and uncovering insights. I am keen to connect with like-minded individuals and teams to tackle complex challenges and create impactful solutions. Letâ€™s harness the power of data together to drive forward-thinking projects and make meaningful contributions to the field.

ðŸ¤” **Seeking Help With**
I'm eager to enhance my expertise in Python, R, and Bash scripting to drive sophisticated data analysis and bioinformatics research. I am particularly interested in mastering these skills to facilitate the integration of multi-omic data and develop robust pipelines for large-scale data analysis. Additionally, I aim to deepen my understanding of software development principles, with a focus on creating innovative solutions for computational biology and health data analytics.

ðŸ’¬ **Ask Me About**
Feel free to ask me anything! I am always up for engaging discussions on bioinformatics, data science, machine learning, and innovative teaching methodologies.

âš¡ **Fun Fact**
I find as much joy in reading, watching new videos in my related field as I do in learning. The pursuit of knowledge is exhilarating, but the ability to share that knowledge and inspire others is truly fulfilling.
